This contains three functions that serve almost no purpose but to exist and illistrate the package building functionality within R.

Project description below along with completion location:
Develop an R package with
* at least three functions (three provided)
* a call to at least one R library (completed in mean_variety())
* check https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html and use @param and @examples in your library (included in documentation of all three functions. State the kind of license (MIT - in description), provide your ORCID identifier (in description)  and those of your collaborators (none). Include a data set of your choice in your package (provided for function in_first_100_primes where a dataset of first 100 primes is stored).

Make your library documentation as detailed as possible (includes parameters, key words and function outlined with example use), and make it available for testing (available publically and 2 tests for 2 functions provided to illistrate capability).
